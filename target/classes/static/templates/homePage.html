    <div class="panel-home-body">This web application was built during my spare time in order to showcase some of my accomplishments and experience. This app integrates some
        common front end technologies such as AngularJS, Bootstrap, and JQuery. It communicates with a Tomcat server, provided by a Spring Boot Java back end application.
        The app also uses Angular routing to dynamically load html content into the body so the navigation tab doesn't need to reload each time. Angular can send requests
        to the Java back end through the http post and get methods as demonstrated below. The input is sent over, picked up by a Spring endpoint, used in Java's Random
        utility, and the result is sent back to be displayed. Both the input and result are bound to variables in the front end controller.
